======================

Working example of how to integrate Nuance Voice SDK into a Cordova 3.x app

Here is a reference to the actual plugin
https://github.com/chalettu/nuance-phonegap-plugin

This sample is meant as a simple integration demo for nuances sdk

Please follow the illustration on step 1 from this page . https://github.com/chalettu/nuance-phonegap-plugin

so you configure the plugin with your credentials in the Plugins/credentials.m file 


Once you do that, you should be able to do a "cordova build ios" and then install it on an IOS device.


TODO-  Work on testing this on Android
